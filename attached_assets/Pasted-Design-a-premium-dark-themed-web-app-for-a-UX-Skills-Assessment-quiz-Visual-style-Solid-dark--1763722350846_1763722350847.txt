Design a premium, dark-themed web app for a "UX Skills Assessment" quiz.

Visual style:

Solid dark background, no gradients (#050814 and #0C101C).

Minimal accent palette using soft gold (#F4B731) and muted orange (#F97316) or teal (#2DD4BF) for key highlights only.

Typography: Use an elegant serif like Newsreader or Playfair Display for main headings and a clean sans like Inter or Manrope for body and UI text. Headings should feel editorial and premium; body text should be highly legible.

Big breathing space, generous padding, soft rounded corners, subtle shadows.

Landing page layout:

Left side: Hero section with headline "Find Your UX Career Stage", supporting description, and a clear primary CTA button "Take the UX Quiz".

Right side: A mock "UX Report Card" preview showing a stage label (e.g. "Emerging Senior"), a circular score indicator, and a few small tags like "Strong in Product Thinking" and "Needs work in Research".

Subtle background accent: a soft blurred glow behind the report card using the accent color.

Quiz screen:

Centered card with the question text, a small progress indicator ("Question 4 of 15" + horizontal progress bar), and five full-width pill-style options stacked vertically.

Clear selected state: solid accent background with white text.

Bottom sticky bar with "Previous" (ghost button) and "Next" (solid accent button).

Results screen:

Top: Stage badge (e.g. "Practitioner", "Emerging Senior", "Strategic Lead") with a short, one-line summary.

Middle: Category breakdown cards for "UX Fundamentals", "UI Craft", "Research & Validation", "Product Thinking", "Collaboration", each with a score and simple horizontal bar indicator.

Bottom: A clean 4-week improvement plan shown as vertical cards: Week 1, Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, each with 2–3 bullet points.

Interactions:

Use very subtle motion: fade-and-slide in main cards, smooth progress bar animations, gentle hover states on buttons (slight scale and brightness change).

No flashy gradients, no overly playful elements. The overall feeling should be calm, confident, and premium, aimed at professional UX designers.
