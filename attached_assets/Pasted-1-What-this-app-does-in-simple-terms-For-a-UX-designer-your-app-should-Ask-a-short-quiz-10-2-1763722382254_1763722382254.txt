1. What this app does (in simple terms)

For a UX designer, your app should:

Ask a short quiz (10–20 questions) about how they work, what they know, what they’ve shipped.

Place them in a “career stage” (e.g. Beginner → Mid → Senior → Lead).

Show a personalised report with:

Where they’re strong / weak (e.g. strong UI, weak research).

What stage they’re closest to.

A concrete improvement plan + reading list / practice tasks.

Think of it as a “UX skills mirror” + mini study coach.

2. Skill areas to measure

Let’s keep it to 5 skill areas for v1:

UX Fundamentals
Flows, usability, information architecture, basic heuristics.

UI Craft & Visual Design
Layout, typography, spacing, hierarchy, interaction patterns.

User Research & Validation
Talking to users, usability tests, using data to make decisions.

Product Thinking & Strategy
Understanding business goals, metrics, impact, prioritisation.

Collaboration & Communication
Working with PM/eng, presenting work, documentation.

Each area gets 3 questions → 15 questions total.
Each question is self-rated 1–5 → max per area = 15, overall = 75.

3. Career stages

Define 4 clear stages:

Explorer (Beginner / Transitioning into UX)

Total score: 0–25

Just learning core concepts, limited real projects.

Practitioner (Junior–Mid)

Total score: 26–45

Can own small features, needs guidance for complex problems.

Emerging Senior

Total score: 46–60

Can lead end-to-end flows, mentor juniors, speak the product language.

Strategic Lead / Manager

Total score: 61–75

Owns problem spaces, influences roadmap, strong on strategy & org impact.

You can tweak the ranges later based on real data.

4. Sample questions (ready to plug into your app)

5. Scoring logic

Implementation idea:

Store questions like this (pseudo-JSON):

{
  "id": "Q1",
  "text": "When you start a new project, how often do you explicitly define the problem statement and success metrics?",
  "category": "ux_fundamentals",
  "scale": {
    "min": 1,
    "max": 5,
    "labels": {
      "1": "Rarely, I mostly start directly with screens",
      "5": "Always, I write a clear problem, constraints, and success metrics"
    }
  }
}


After user submits:

Sum scores per category.

Sum all scores for total.

totalScore → map to career stage.

For each category, classify as:

1–5 → Needs work

6–10 → Decent

11–15 → Strong

Output object:

{
  "totalScore": 48,
  "stage": "Emerging Senior",
  "categoryScores": {
    "ux_fundamentals": 11,
    "ui_craft": 9,
    "research": 7,
    "product_thinking": 12,
    "collaboration": 9
  }
}


Then use this to generate a personalised report UI.

6. Feedback templates by stage

You can hard-code these as templates and inject category highlights.

Stage 1 – Explorer

Summary:
“You’re in the early stage of your UX journey or transitioning from another field. Your main focus now should be building strong fundamentals and getting hands-on with small projects.”

What to focus on:

Learn basic UX concepts: flows, wireframes, usability heuristics.

Practice simple apps: redesign a login flow, onboarding, or checkout.

Get feedback from other designers (Discord, design communities, friends).

Study plan (4 weeks, light):

Week 1: Learn UX basics (heuristics, flows, wireframes).

Week 2: Pick one app you use daily and sketch a better version of 1 flow.

Week 3: Do 2–3 user conversations with friends/family using that app.

Week 4: Refine your design based on feedback and write a 1-page case study.

Stage 2 – Practitioner

Summary:
“You’re functioning as a UX designer and can handle features with guidance. Now it’s about depth: better research, stronger visual craft, and thinking more about impact/metrics.”

What to focus on:

Push your UI craft (spacings, grids, typography, states).

Practice structured research: plan > interview > synthesise > design.

Start thinking in hypotheses and metrics: ‘If we change X, Y should improve’.

Study plan (4–6 weeks):

Pick one live feature from your current or a fake product.

Write a short problem statement + success metric.

Talk to 3–5 users (or proxy users).

Design 2–3 variations, get feedback from a PM/dev friend if possible.

Document it as a proper case study.

Stage 3 – Emerging Senior

Summary:
“You’re close to or already functioning at a senior level. You can drive flows end-to-end and work well with PM/eng. Next step is sharpening strategy, systems thinking, and mentoring.”

What to focus on:

Define problem spaces, not just features.

Get more fluent in data: funnels, conversion, retention, A/B basics.

Start mentoring juniors or giving feedback regularly.

Contribute seriously to design systems and patterns.

Study / growth ideas:

Pick a core funnel (e.g. search → book, browse → purchase) and map it.

Identify drop-off points, propose 2–3 experiments.

Run a small usability study for a critical flow and share the findings.

Write internal docs: “Design principles for [your product]”.

Stage 4 – Strategic Lead

Summary:
“You’re already operating at a high level. Your edge now is strategy, org influence, and building systems (design system, UX ops, research ops).”

What to focus on:

Owning problem spaces, not just features.

Connecting company strategy → roadmap → design bets.

Creating design frameworks others can reuse: templates, checklists, playbooks.

Coaching others and shaping the design culture.

Study / growth ideas:

Drive a 0→1 initiative and document decision trade-offs.

Build a design quality bar document with examples and use it in reviews.

Partner with data/PM to define north star metrics for the UX team.

7. Making the output feel personalised

Use the category scores to give targeted advice. Example:

“Your strongest area right now is Product Thinking (12/15) – you clearly think in terms of impact and business goals.
Your biggest opportunity is Research & Validation (6/15) – try to bring users into your process more often and run quick tests before shipping.”

You can have a small library of suggestions per category & level, then pick based on score.

8. How we can continue

Next step (if you want) we can:

Turn this into actual UI flows (welcome → quiz → results → “start plan”).

Design the result screen layout.

Or I can give you a JSON schema + sample dataset you can directly plug into your frontend/backend.
