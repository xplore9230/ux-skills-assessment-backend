Create a list of these heuristics and explain how they relate to your design decisions.\n  - Create a simple wireframe of a common UX pattern (e.g., login form, search bar) using the 8-point grid system. Focus on creating a clear and consistent layout.\n  - Write a short reflection (approx. 250 words) on what you learned about UX Fundamentals from the Laws of UX website. How do these principles apply to your current design work?\n\nWeek 2:\n  - Conduct a self-assessment of your user research skills by reviewing 5 existing user studies or research papers. Identify areas where you can improve and create an action plan to address them.\n  - Create a user persona for a fictional product using the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. Focus on understanding the user's motivations, goals, and pain points.\n  - Redesign your portfolio's navigation using the 8-point grid system. Ensure that the new design is intuitive, consistent, and easy to use.\n\nWeek 3:\n  - Apply Occam's Razor to a current design project by identifying unnecessary complexity and simplifying it. Document your thought process and design decisions.\n  - Create a list of 5 potential user research methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, usability testing) and explain their strengths and weaknesses. Choose one method to try on a small-scale project.\n  - Write a short essay (approx. 500 words) on the importance of Aesthetic-Usability Effect in UX design. Provide examples of how this principle can be applied in your current work.\n\nWeek 4:\n  - Develop a comprehensive user research plan for a hypothetical product launch. Outline the methods, tools, and timelines for conducting user research.\n  - Create a design system document that outlines the principles, components, and guidelines for your current design work. Focus on consistency and usability.\n  - Conduct 2 user interviews using the Jobs-to-be-Done framework and document 5 pain points. Analyze the results and provide recommendations for product development.\n\n",

Document your findings.\n  - Write a short essay (approx. 250 words) explaining how Tesler’s Law applies to your current design work, and provide examples from your own projects.\n  - Create an annotated wireframe of a hypothetical app, highlighting specific design decisions that demonstrate the Aesthetic-Usability Effect.\n\nWeek 4:\n  - Design a comprehensive usability test plan for a new feature in a product you're familiar with, incorporating at least three user research methods.\n  - Develop an advanced heuristic evaluation checklist for your own designs, focusing on usability and accessibility. Document your process and results.\n  - Create a case study (approx. 500 words) of a successful design project that demonstrates your understanding of UX principles and strategies.\n\n",

Document each pain point with 2 possible solutions and rate their feasibility (1-5) on a scale from 'not feasible' to 'very feasible'. This will help you better understand user needs and identify areas for improvement in Product Thinking & Strategy (Reference: Conducting User Research).\n  - Create a mind map of the 8-point grid system, illustrating how it can be applied to your portfolio's navigation. Focus on visualizing the relationships between elements and identifying potential improvements. This will help you better understand UI Craft & Visual Design principles (Reference: Tesler’s Law).\n  - Design a simple wireframe for a hypothetical product feature using Hick’s Law as a guide. Ensure that the user can complete the task in 2-3 steps, with minimal cognitive load. This will help you apply UX Fundamentals principles to real-world design challenges.\n\nWeek 2:\n  - Conduct 1 user interview and document 3 pain points using the Jobs-to-be-Done framework. Analyze your findings and identify potential solutions that align with Product Thinking & Strategy principles (Reference: Laws of UX).\n  - Redesign a existing product's navigation using the 8-point grid system, focusing on visual hierarchy and information architecture. This will help you apply UI Craft & Visual Design principles to real-world design challenges.\n  - Create a list of 3 common usability heuristics that are often overlooked in design. Provide examples of how these heuristics can be applied to improve user experience (Reference: 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design).\n\nWeek 3:\n  - Create a case study of a successful product redesign that incorporates Product Thinking & Strategy principles. Analyze the design decisions and identify key takeaways for improving your own work (Reference: Laws of UX).\n  - Design a prototype of a hypothetical feature using Aesthetic-Usability Effect as a guide. Ensure that the design is visually appealing and easy to use. This will help you apply UX Fundamentals principles to real-world design challenges.\n  - Write a short reflection on your own collaboration style, identifying areas for improvement in Communication & Collaboration (Reference: Tesler’s Law).\n\nWeek 4:\n  - Develop a comprehensive Product Thinking & Strategy plan for a hypothetical product feature. Include user research findings, design decisions, and key performance indicators (KPIs) to measure success.\n  - Create a visual design system that incorporates the 8-point grid system and Hick’s Law principles. Document your design decisions and provide examples of how this system can be applied to real-world projects.\n  - Conduct a peer review of your own portfolio, providing constructive feedback on UI Craft & Visual Design principles (Reference: Tesler’s Law).\n\n",

Use these insights to inform a redesign of those sections.\n  - Create a simple user journey map for a hypothetical product feature, using the 'Aesthetic-Usability Effect' principles to guide your design decisions.\n  - Develop a basic prototype of an error state for a login form, using 10 Usability Heuristics as a reference point. Document your thought process and design choices.\n\nWeek 3:\n  - Write a short essay (approx. 250-300 words) explaining how you would apply Miller's Law to optimize the navigation of an e-commerce website, including specific examples and design decisions.\n  - Create a list of 5 potential user research questions for a hypothetical product feature, using the 'Laws of UX' principles to guide your question development.\n  - Develop a basic wireframe of a hypothetical product feature, focusing on how it meets the needs of users with disabilities.

Create a list of specific changes to implement in your next project.\n  - Redesign a simple webpage using only Hick’s Law, Tesler’s Law, Aesthetic-Usability Effect, and Laws of UX as guidelines. This will help you understand how these principles apply to UI design.\n  - Create a mind map or diagram illustrating the 8-point grid system for navigation. Practice applying this system to your portfolio's navigation.\n\nWeek 2:\n  - Conduct a self-assessment of your wireframing skills. Create 5 new wireframes for a hypothetical product, focusing on error states and user flow. Compare these to your previous work and identify areas for improvement.\n  - Apply the Jobs-to-be-Done framework to 2 existing products or services. Document 3 pain points for each product and brainstorm potential solutions.\n  - Redesign a familiar UI element (e.g., a login form) using only UI Craft & Visual Design principles. Focus on creating an intuitive and aesthetically pleasing experience.\n\nWeek 3:\n  - Create a case study of a successful product redesign that incorporated UX Fundamentals effectively. Analyze the design decisions made and how they contributed to the product's success.\n  - Develop a simple prototype using a tool like Figma or Sketch, applying the principles learned from Laws of UX. Test your prototype with 2 users and gather feedback.\n  - Write a short article (approx. 500 words) discussing the importance of UX Fundamentals in Strategic Lead design. Share your insights on how these principles can be applied to real-world projects.\n\nWeek 4:\n  - Design a comprehensive user research study for a new product idea. Develop a plan for data collection, analysis, and reporting.\n  - Create a visual design system for a hypothetical company, incorporating the principles learned from Laws of UX. Document your design decisions and rationale.\n  - Develop a capstone project that showcases your skills in UX Fundamentals, UI Craft & Visual Design, User Research & Validation, Product Thinking & Strategy, and Collaboration & Communication. Present your project to a peer group or mentor.\n\n",
